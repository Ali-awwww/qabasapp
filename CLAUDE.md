# Project Instructions for AI Agents

# MANDATORY LAW & CORE OPERATIONAL CONSTITUTION
> **CRITICAL LAW FOR ALL AI AGENTS & DEVELOPERS:**
> Every assistant (human or AI) starting or working on this codebase **MUST READ AND ADHERE TO `/CORE_OPERATIONAL_PROMPT.md`** before making any code updates.

```
1. ABSOLUTE HONESTY & VERIFICATION: Lying or unverified completion reports are strictly prohibited. Every claim of completion must be verified by successful compilation (`compile_applet`).
2. UI MICRO-SCALING & ANTI-BLOAT LAW: Oversized inputs, bloated cards, or excessive paddings are strictly forbidden. Use compact inputs (48-52dp height), 8/12dp grid padding, and replace heavy logos with bold, elegant typography (App Name).
3. MANDATORY INTERNET RESEARCH ON INCOMPLETE PROMPTS: If user prompt lacks details/components, the assistant MUST search the web/docs for similar apps and features, analyze best practices, and implement them proactively without stopping.
4. 100% SCOPE EXECUTION & CONTINUITY: Never leave features half-baked. If session time runs out, explicitly ask for permission to continue until achieving full 100% completion.
5. NO MOCK DATA & DATA SANITATION: Fake buttons, non-functional toasts, or residual dummy data are strictly forbidden. All features must connect to real data layers.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/core-concepts/sync-concepts.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.
